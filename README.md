## Introduction

The degassing process is one of the essential processes in silicone moulding to eliminate entrapped air and remove bubbles from the silicone. 
For large capacity (e.g. 5 gallons), the degassing process typically uses a vacuum pump and vacuum chamber to reach -29 inHg or -1 bar, 
as in the following example from [smooth-on](https://www.smooth-on.com/tutorials/vacuum-degas-silicone-mold-max-30/) [^1]. 
However, a vacuum pump is relatively expensive for the small capacity (e.g. 10 - 20 ml) of silicone moulding, with an estimated price of around Â£1100. 
Therefore, to resolve the problem with the vacuum pump, this repository will show the tutorial to build low-cost vacuum degassing machine with 50 ml syringe and a stepper motor that will be controlled by `Arduino`.
